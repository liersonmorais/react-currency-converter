 For a job offer, a currency and exchange converter.
 
 For Red Acre, created a exchange and currency converter using React and Coinlayer API.
 
 Flaws:
 
 - the second field is not converting; working on it;
 - No connection to any database.
 - The assignment included a MongoDb Connection and an access to a data table where it would be recorded all the transactions.
 
 Improvements:
 - Dockerize.
 - Data filter.
